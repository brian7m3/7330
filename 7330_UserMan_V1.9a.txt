Security 

 

 

 

One of the Security features used by the computer is a dual-password system. 
There are two levels of command privileges. 

 The operators holding the Master Password are the higher level group, 
since the master password may be used with all control commands. 
 The operators holding the Control Operator Password are the lower level 
group, since their password only works with certain owner-designated 
control commands. 


You may select the commands that are available to the control operators, 
which range from none to all commands. 

 The master password and the control operator password may be 2, 4, or 6 
digits long. 
 The passwords may contain the numbers 0-9, and the lettered keys A, B, C, 
and D. 


There are several features that you can use to improve the security of the 
controller. You can hide DTMF tones on the output of the repeater by enabling 
DTMF Mute (see page 7-19) and the DTMF Cover Tone (see page 7-24). You 
can limit all commands on a radio port to 4 digits long (see page 7-14). 

To enhance security at your site, you can disable the LEDs on the Front Panel 
Display. Disabling the Front Panel Display prevents display of all LEDs on the 
front panel except the power LED. The Power LED is always on when power is 
applied to the controller. 




 

Assign Master Password 

Assigns a new master password. 

 The new Master Password may be 2, 4, or 6 digits in length. 
 The new Master Password may be any combination of the numbers 0-9 and 
the letters A-D.

it to 95, enter this: 

(PW) 92 95 * 

"(PW)" must be the master password, since no control operator password 
exists. 

If the master password is 2A3B4C, enter this: 

2A3B4C 92 95 * 


 

Assign Control Operator Privilege Level 

 

Limits access of control operators to the repeater functions by 
assigning privilege levels to control commands. 

 

 Enter the root number of the command for which a privilege level change is 
desired, then enter a 0 or 1 for the privilege level. See the root number 
table at page A-34. 
 0 = control command may be used by either the master or the control 
operator password. 
 1 = control command may be used only by the master password.

prevent control operators from changing either the master password or the 
control operator password, enter this: 

(PW) 94 92 1 * 

(PW) 94 93 1 * 

Root 92 is the Assign Control Operator Password command on page 4-3. 
Root 93 is the Assign Master Password command on page 4-2. 

Note: If you want to prevent a control operator from accessing more than one 
root code in a row, use the Assign Control Operator Privilege Level to a Range 
of Commands command (see page 4-5.) 


 

Assign Control Operator Privilege Level to a 
Range of Commands 

 

Changes the Control Operator Privilege on a range of 
commands. 

 

 Enter the first and last root number of the command for which a privilege 
level change is desired, then enter a 0 or 1 for the privilege level. See the 
root number table at page A-34. 
 0 = control command may be used by either the master or the control 
operator password. 
 1 = control command may be used only by the master password.

Chapter 21 

Clock and 
Calendar 

 

 

 

The Controller features a hardware real-time clock and calendar circuit with a 
lithium power source. Accurate time keeping is maintained during loss of main 
power. 

 

To announce the time or date, you place special codes called Message Run- 
Time Variables into messages. (See page 6-55 for more information.) The 
clock is also used with the scheduler to execute macros based on the calendar 
and time. Please see chapter 22, Scheduler, for more information on this 
powerful capability. 

 

The clock and calendar circuit is accurate to 1 minute per year. For improved 
accuracy, commands are provided to manually or automatically adjust the clock 
to compensate for drift. 

 

Leap years are automatically adjusted. 


 

Set Clock and Calendar 

 

Sets the clock and calendar. 

 

 Enter all parameters shown below each time that you set the Clock and 
Calendar. Seconds are optional. 
 All parameters consist of two digits except the day-of-week, which is one 
digit. 
 The year parameter is needed for leap year correction. 
 The clock and calendar is set when you release the (*) button. 
 Seconds are automatically set to 00 if not entered.

Example: 

Let’s set the clock to 6:02 PM (18:02) on Monday, October 22, 2012. 

The year is 12, the month is 10, the day-of-month is 22, the day-of-week is 1, 
the hour is 18, and the minute is 02. The seconds default to 00 and are not 
specified in the example. The entire example command is: 

(PW) 25 12 10 22 1 18 02 * 


 

Adjust Daylight Saving Time 

 

Forces the clock to add, or subtract, 1-hour. 

 

 For the United States Daylight Saving Time program, see the 
Enable/Disable Automatic Daylight Saving Time Adjustment command on 
page 21-9. 
 This command simplifies the semi-annual job of resetting the clock for 
customers affected by Daylight Saving Time. Instead of resetting the entire 
clock and calendar, use this command to add or subtract one hour. 
 Don’t use the “fall back” command between midnight and 12:59 AM (00:59). 
Otherwise, the hour will change to 23 (11:xx PM, 23:xx), but the day won’t 
roll back. You will gain another day at midnight. 
 Don’t use the “spring ahead” command between 11:00 PM (23:00) and 
midnight. Otherwise, the hour will change to 00, but the day won’t roll 
forward. You will lose a day. 
 If you are using the Scheduler to automatically “fall back”, use the version of 
the “fall back” command with the inhibit. This prevents the scheduler from 
executing the command more than once.

(PW) 48 1 * 

To automatically set the clock 1-hour ahead on the second Sunday of March at 
2 AM (02:00) using the Scheduler, create a macro (9000 for this example) and 
a Scheduler setpoint (00 for this example): 

(PW) 20 9000 MPW 48 1 * 
(PW) 28 00 9000 03 48 02 00 * 

To manually set the clock 1-hour behind, enter the command: 

(PW) 48 0 * 

To automatically set the clock 1-hour behind on the first Sunday in November 
at 2 AM (02:00) using the Scheduler, create a macro (9001 for this example) 
and a Scheduler setpoint (01 for this example): 

(PW) 20 9001 MPW 48 2 * 
(PW) 28 01 9001 11 41 02 00 * 

 

 

Note: See Chapter 22, Scheduler, for more information on setting a Scheduler 
setpoint. 


 

Reset Clock Seconds 

 

Forces the clock to set the seconds to zero. 

 

 This command simplifies the periodic synchronization of the clock to a time 
reference, either manually or automatically. 
 If the seconds of the clock are ahead of the time reference by 1 to 29 
seconds, the seconds will be reset to zero. 
 If the seconds of the clock are behind the time reference by 1 to 30 
seconds, the seconds will be reset to zero and the minute and hour will be 
incremented, if required. 
 Don’t use this command between 11:59 PM (23:59) and 12:01 AM (00:01). 
Otherwise, the time will be adjusted, but the day will be wrong.

Example: 

To manually reset the seconds of the clock, enter the command: 

(PW) 48 3 * 

When entering the command, press and hold the star (*) at the end of the command. 
Release the star when your time reference signals its zero mark. This will zero the 
seconds of the clock in synchronization with your time reference. 

To automatically reset the seconds of the clock from external hardware, connect the 
hardware to a Logic Input. Create a macro (9000 in this example) and assign it to a 
Logic Input (the Hi-To-Low transition of #1 in this example): 

(PW) 20 9000 (PW) 48 3 * 
(PW) 26 20 9000 * 

Note: See Chapter 14, Logic Inputs, for more information on using Logic 
Inputs. 


 

Adjust Clock Seconds 

 

Forces the clock to add or subtract seconds. 

 

 This command simplifies the periodic synchronization of the clock without a 
time reference. 
 This command is usually used with the Scheduler to allow the controller to 
adjust its own time. 
 Don’t use this command between 11:59 PM (23:59) and 12:01 AM (00:01). 
Otherwise, the time will be adjusted, but the day will be wrong. 
 Use the Message Run-Time Variable 9816, “Seconds, CW”, or 9832 
“Seconds, male voice” to check the amount of correction required. 
 If you are using the Scheduler to automatically subtract seconds from the 
clock, use the version of the Subtract Clock Seconds command with the 
inhibit. This prevents the scheduler from executing the command more 
than once.

Default Condition: None 

 

Example: 

Using the Scheduler, the accuracy of the clock over long periods of time can be 
improved. To know how much adjustment will be required, use the Reset 
Clock Seconds command to manually synchronize the clock to a time 
reference. A week later, enter the command to speak the seconds, for 
example: 

(PW) 15 9832 * 


When entering the command, press and hold the star (*) at the end of the 
command. Release the star when your time reference signals its zero mark. 
This will cause the controller to speak the seconds reading on the clock at that 
time. 

Note the amount that the clock is off from the reference. This is the amount of 
drift in the clock over a week. Take these readings each week at 
approximately the same time to understand the amount of drift. 

Since the adjustment commands will only adjust the clock up to 29 seconds 
ahead or 30 seconds behind, you will need to set a Scheduler setpoint that 
occurs when the drift is less than that. Once-a-week or once-a-month may be 
appropriate depending on your situation. 

To automatically adjust the seconds of the clock (subtract 7 seconds for this 
example) on the first Monday of every month at 2:00 AM (02:00) using the 
Scheduler, create a macro (9000 for this example) and a Scheduler setpoint 
(00 for this example): 

(PW) 20 9000 MPW 48 6 07 * 
(PW) 28 00 9000 99 42 02 00 * 

Note that the ambient temperature that the controller is subjected to may 
change the amount, and direction, of the clock drift. You may need to change 
the adjustment at different times of the year. 

 

 

 

Note: See Chapter 22, Scheduler, for more information on setting a Scheduler 
setpoint.
